This repository contains deep learning models for brain tumor segmentation, including ResNet, UNet, SegNet3, SegNet5 and hybrid models like Seg-UNet, USegNet and Unet-ResNet. Utilizing a Kaggle MRI dataset, we preprocessed, trained, and evaluated these CNN architectures. ResNet leads in mean accuracy, while Seg-UNet excels in multiple metrics like Cohenâ€™s Kappa, MCC, Roc-AUC, F1 score, Jaccard, Recall, Precision, Specificity, and Dice coefficient. Segnet3 offers the fastest test time but has lower performance in other metrics. Overall, Seg-UNet is the top performer across most metrics, balancing accuracy and efficiency.
